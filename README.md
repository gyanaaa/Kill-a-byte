##### SANJEEVANI
What is it about??
It's basicaly a e-booth clinic service set up in regional parts for majority of people living in rural regions.
## Why we chose Sanjeevani.
We all know the shortage and lack of basic health amenities at the rural regions, thus our initiative was to provide them the medium between the patient and the medical practitioners. Our vision is to provide healthcare facilities at one step , one click. Majority of people living in rural areas die of diseases they arent properly diagnosed let alone aware of, thus our initiative at sanjeevani brings you to the scope of better health and medicare.
## What Sanjeevani Offers
Every rural region would have a booth set up where the patients who need help will directly contact our assistants, and the assistants will provide them the pharmaceutical help and doctor's prescription at one place, one go. At the website we will provide a medium between the patient and the doctor as well the patient and assistant. The Assistant will be available 24*7 and assist them in their needs and requirements. We provide a E-clinic, Emergency, and the details of doctor, assistant and the pharmacy details. It is bilingual so that they understand it better.
